#### Negatives
+ keep css styling in separate document, cover overlapping styles  
+ add comments that explain code and different functions
+ the code needs to be clear of the print statements used to test it (or just comment it out)
+ the password should have restrictions (i.e length > 0)
+ the picture should be optional, and not just of Rick =)
